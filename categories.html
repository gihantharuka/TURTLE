                Turtles are fascinating creatures that have been around for over 200
                million years. They are known for their unique shells, which provide
                them with protection and stability, and their slow and steady movements.
                Turtles are found all over the world, living in a variety of habitats
                including oceans, rivers, lakes, forests, and deserts.</p>
            <p> over 300
                different species, turtles come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and
                colors. Despite their long history and diversity, turtles face numerous
                threats to their survival including habitat loss, poaching, and climate
                change. As a result, many efforts are being made to protect and conserve
                these ancient and important species.

            <p>
                Green sea turtle is named for the green color of the fat under its shell. (In some areas, the Pacific green turtle is
                also called the black sea turtle.) They are easily distinguished from other sea turtles because they have a single pair of prefrontal scales (scales in
                front of its eyes), rather than two pairs as found on other sea turtles. Head is small and blunt with a serrated jaw.
             </p>
            <p>
            Diet of the Green turtle changes significantly during its life. When less than 8 to 10 inches in length eat worms, young crustaceans, aquatic
            insects, grasses and algae. Once green turtles reach 8 to 10 inches in length, they mostly eat sea grass and algae, the
            only sea turtle that is strictly herbivorous as an adult.
           </p>
            <p>
                Green turtles nest at intervals of about every 2 years, with wide year-to-year fluctuations in numbers of nesting
                females.

                The Green turtles mainly stay near the coastline and around islands and live in bays and protected shores,
                especially in areas with
                seagrass beds. Rarely are they observed in the open ocean.

                known sea
                turtles. Green turtles nest all year round in Sri Lanka, with the highest abundance reported in Kosgoda
                (north of Galle) and
                Rekawa (near Tangalle). The best time to see them nest is between January and March.

                Hawksbill is named for its narrow head and hawk-like beak. The hawksbill is one of the smaller sea
                turtles. Head is
                narrow and has 2 pairs of prefrontal scales (scales in front of its eyes). Jaw is not serrated. Carapace
                is bony without
                ridges and has large, overlapping scutes (scales) present and has 4 lateral scutes. Carapace is
                elliptical in shape.
                Flippers have 2 claws. The carapace is orange, brown or yellow and hatchlings are mostly brown with pale
                blotches on
                scutes.

                amongst others. They Nest at intervals of 2 to 4 years. Nests between 3 to 6 times per season. Lays an average 160 eggs in each nest. Eggs
                incubate for about 60 days.

            <p>
                The adults measure 2 to 2.5 feet (62-70 cm) in carapace length. Adult turtles weigh between 77 and 100 pounds (35-45 kg).The Olive Ridley feeds mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, mollusks and fish and has an average lifespan of 50 years.

            </p>
            <p>
            The Olive Ridley turtles nest every year in mass synchronized nestings called arribadas (Spanish for “arrival”). Only the Kemp’s ridley also
            nests this way. Nests 2 times each season. An average clutch size is over 110 eggs which require a 52 to 58 day

                They are generally found in coastal bays and estuaries, but can be very oceanic over some parts of its range. They
                typically
                forage off shore in surface waters or dive to depths of 500 feet (150 m) to feed on bottom dwelling crustaceans. The olive ridley inhabits tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans.

                Loggerhead turtle is named for its exceptionally large head. Head is very large with heavy strong jaws. Carapace is bony without ridges and has large, non-overlapping, rough scutes
                (scales) present with 5 lateral scute. Carapace is heart shaped. Front flippers are short and thick with 2 claws, while
                the rear flippers can have 2 or 3 claws.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Loggerhead turtles are primarily carnivorous and feed mostly on shellfish that live on the bottom of the ocean. They eat horseshoe crabs,
                clams, mussels, and other invertebrates. Their powerful jaw muscles help them to easily crush the shellfish.
            </p>
            <p>
                They nests at intervals of 2 to 4 years. They lay 3 to 6 nests per season, approximately 12 to 14 days apart. Lays average of

            Loggerhead turtles are a rare species in Sri Lanka and sightings of them are very rare. The majority of sea turtle
            conservation projects and turtle watching tours in Sri Lanka focus on the Olive Ridley, Green and Leatherback turtles.

            </p>
            <p>
            However, there is a chance of seeing loggerhead turtles on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, especially in the waters
            around Galle, Mirissa, and Tangalle. Visitors can try going on a whale and dolphin watching tour or hire a local
            fisherman to take them out to sea for a chance to spot loggerhead turtles.

            <h2 id="leather" class="whead">Leatherback Turtle</h2>
            <p>
                The Leatherback turtle is named for its unique shell which is composed of a layer of thin, tough, rubbery skin, strengthened by
                thousands of tiny bone plates that makes it look “leathery”. Head has a deeply notched upper jaw with 2 cusps. The leatherback is the only sea turtle that lacks a hard shell. Its
                carapace is large, elongated and flexible with 7 distinct ridges running the length of the animal. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leatherbacks have delicate, scissor-like jaws. Their jaws would be damaged by anything other than a diet of soft-bodied
                animals, so they feed almost exclusively on jellyfish. It is remarkable that this large, active animal can survive on a
                diet of jellyfish, which are composed mostly of water and appear to be a poor source of nutrients.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are primarily found in the open ocean, as far north as Alaska and as far south as the southern tip of Africa, though recent
                satellite tracking research indicates that leatherbacks feed in areas just offshore.
